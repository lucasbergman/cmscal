# `cmscal`: Add the Clark Middle School calendar to apps

I’m a parent of a [Clark Middle School](https://clark.lcsc.us/) student, so I
made a program to publish the school schedule for sixth, seventh, and eighth
grades to calendar apps. It should work with any modern, popular calendar
app. If you find any bugs, [send me a message](mailto:lucas@bergmans.us).

## How to subscribe to the calendar

### Apple (iPhone, iPad)

These instructions are current for iOS 13. See [the Calendar chapter in
Apple’s iPhone user
guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-multiple-calendars-iph3d1110d4/ios)
for more information.

1. Launch the **Settings** app
1. Navigate to “Passwords & Accounts” → “Add Account” → “Other”
1. Tap “Add Subscribed Calendar”
1. Enter the calendar URL for the grade you want:
   *  https://cmscal.bergmans.us/6 (sixth grade)
   *  https://cmscal.bergmans.us/7 (seventh grade)
   *  https://cmscal.bergmans.us/8 (eighth grade)

Now launch the **Calendar** app, and the new Clark Middle School calendar will
be available to view.

### Google Calendar (Android, iPhone, iPad, computer)

You can’t subscribe to new calendars from Google Calendar mobile apps, so you
have to go to [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com/) on the web,
preferably from a laptop or desktop.

1. On the left side, under “Other calendars” click the “+” icon
1. Click “From URL”
1. Enter the calendar URL for the grade you want:
   *  https://cmscal.bergmans.us/6 (sixth grade)
   *  https://cmscal.bergmans.us/7 (seventh grade)
   *  https://cmscal.bergmans.us/8 (eighth grade)

Now the new Clark Middle School calendar will be available to view. If you’re
using the Google Calendar mobile app, check settings and you’ll see the new
calendar available to sync to your device.
